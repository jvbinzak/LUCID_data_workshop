# Repository for the LUCID data-worshop summer 2019

## Sesion 1: Introduction to data science with R

This session will introduce you working with data in an “integrated development environment” or IDE using the freely available and widely-used software package R. We will briefly discuss what is meant by the term “data science,” why data science is increasingly important in Psychology and Neuroscience, and how it differs from traditional statistical analysis. We will then get a sense for how IDEs work by building, from data generated in the workshop, an interactive graph showing the structure of your mental semantic network.

Preparation for the workshop: (TO DO before arriving on Tuesday!)
– Install R, R Studio, and Swirl on your laptop following the instructions here: swirlstats.com/students  
– Start Swirl as instructed at the website and install the first course module by following the prompts  
– Run yourself through the first course module  

Time to complete: 45-60 minutes. Feel free to work with a partner or in groups!

## Sesion 2: Introduction to data science Tools

In this session we will set up several data science tools and environments: ATOM text editor, Jupyter, IRKernel (to run R on Jupyter), Git (Mac/Linux) or GitBash (Windows), GitHub account, GitHub Repository, a folder system and MATLAB. Then we will go over the basics of how to open, run and test each tool.
Preparation for the workshop:

– Download MATLAB (not install) for your OS (Mac/Windows/Linux) login in the Campus Software Library: it.wisc.edu/services/software  
– Download and install Atom text editor from atom.io  
– Download and install Git* from git-scm.com/downloads  
Windows users: when installing git, make sure you have the ‘GitBash Here’ selected.

## Session 3: Linear Regression Models in R

This session will introduce you to working with linear regression models using R. We will briefly discuss why linear regression is useful for Psychology and Educational research, using the topic of numerical cognition as an example.  We will play an educational game to generate our own data in the work shop, form predictions, and test those predictions by modeling gameplay performance. Through this exercise we will cover how to fit linear regression models, assess the fit of those models, plot linear relationships, and draw statistical inferences.
Preparation for the workshop: (TO DO before arriving on Tuesday!)

– Be ready to uses R, R Studio, and Swirl on your laptop following the instructions here: swirlstats.com/students
–Install the “Regression Models” swirl modual using the following commands in R
> library(swirl)
> swirl::install_course("Regression Models")
> swirl()
– Run yourself through lessons 1-6 (Introduction-MultiVar Examples) and continue based on your interest.

Time to complete: 45-60 minutes. Feel free to work with a partner or in groups!
